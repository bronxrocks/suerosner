          World Over - Dion DiMucci, his life and music - Raymond Arroyo with Dion DiMucci EWTN-TV  08-11-2011 on You Tube>

       There is no music icon more associated with the Bronx than Dion DiMucci. Even his group,
       the Belmonts, took its name from Belmont Avenue, the street on which member Fred Milano lived.
       Carlo Mastrangelo (bass), Fred Milano (second tenor), Angelo D'Aleo (first tenor), and Dion all grew up in 
       the Arthur Avenue/Little Italy section of the Bronx. According to an interview Dion gave Raymond Arroyo, of EWTN-TV, Angelo was
       an opera singer. Fred knew a lot about harmony, and Carlo was a jazz drummer who could scat.

        Dion & the Belmonts scored their first Top 40 hit with <i>I Wonder Why</i>. This was followed with
        <i>No One Knows</i> and <i>Don't Pity Me</i>, both Top 40 hits. The following year they cracked the Top 10
        with <i>A Teenager in Love</i>. That winter while <i>A Teenager in Love</i> moved up the charts, 
        Dion & the Belmonts joined the ill-fated Winter Dance Party that included Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper
        (J.P. Richardson), and Ritchie Valens. On February 3, 1959, after a concert stop in Clear Lake, Iowa, 
        Holly and others decided to charter a flight to the next venue rather than travel on the tour bus. 
        Dion was invited to accompany the group but decided that he did not want to spend $36 for the flight,
        which was the same amount as the rent his parents paid for his childhood apartment and he couldn't 
        justify the indulgence. The plane crashed, killing all on board.

       Dion & the Belmonts biggest hit <i>Where or When</i> (#3) was 
       released in November of 1959. Dion's drug dependency worsened. While <i>Where or When</i> climbed the charts,
       Dion was in the hospital detoxifying. By the early 60s Dion and the Belmonts broke up.
       The main reason was Dion's heroin habit which he had been nurturing since he was sixteen.

       Dion scored a Top 20 hit with his first record as a solo artist, <i>Lonely Teenager</i>. His biggest hit 
       was a song he co-wrote with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Maresca">Ernie Maresca</a>,
       <i>Runaround Sue</i> (#1). Dion teamed up again with Maresca for <i>The Wanderer</i> (#2). The song was about 
       a guy from Dion's neighborhood, Jackie Burns, who had tatoos all over him. More hits followed:
       <i>Lovers Who Wander"</i> (#3), 
       and <i>Little Diane</i> (#8) in 1962. He scored four more top 10 hits in 1963, <i>Love Came to Me</i> (#10),  
       <i>Ruby Baby</i> (#2), <i>Donna the Prima Donna</i>, (inspired by Dion's sister, Donna) (#6), and <i>Drip Drop</i> (#6),

       In early 1986, Dion moved with his wife and daughter to Miami to get a fresh start. Dion credits his father-in-law, Jack with helping him kick his drug addiction. 
       In an interview with Raymond Arroyo, of EWTN-TV, Dion disclosed that he had a conversation with Jack. In that discussion, Jack told Dion,
       "if you find the God of your understanding, God will solve your problem. You can't solve it. 
       It's like your mind is broken.You can't solve or heal anything with a broken mind."        
       He saw his father-in-law, who had a physique that reminded him of John Wayne, on his knees praying. 
       Dion decided to try doing the same. After that, Dion was never the same. He claims he hasn't used 
       drugs or alcohol from that point forward. Later that year, he recorded <i>Abraham, Martin, & John</i>. 
       The song is a tribute to the memory of Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and 
       the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. The song was a departure for Dion, in that it had none of his usual
       Bronx swagger. It was recorded in a more folk and introspective style.

       In 1988 Dion's autobiography, <i>The Wanderer: Dion's Story</i>, co-authored by Davin Seay was
       published.
