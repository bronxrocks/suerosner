            Bobby Darin was born Walden Robert Cassotto in <a href="http://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/bellevue/html/home/home.shtml">
            Bellevue Hospital</a>, New York City, on May 14, 1936. As a child, he suffered from rheumatic fever, which left him with a seriously 
            weakend heart. When he was around 6 or 7, he overheard a doctor saying that he didn't expect the child 
            to live a long life. Knowing this, his ambition was to become a legend by the time he was 25.

            By the time he was a teenager, he could play several instruments, including piano, drums, and guitar. 
            He later added harmonica and xylophone. He never seriously considered a career in music until after
            he enrolled at <a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/main/ ">Hunter College</a>. He left Hunter after
            a couple of semesters, and got a job first as a demo writer then as a demo singer at the legendary 
            <a href="http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/eras/C1109">Brill Building </a> in New York City.

            Darin's career took off in 1958 when he recorded <i>Splish Splash</i>, a song that Darin says he wrote in 
            12 minutes. The hits followed with <i>Queen of the Hop</i> (#9) and <i>Dream Lover</i>
            (#2). His biggest success would come the following year with <i>Mack the Knife</i>. It spent
            nine weeks at #1 and sold 2 million copies. The song became his signature song and would earn
            a Grammy for Record of the Year, while Darin won the Grammy for Best New Artist. The song also reflected
            on Darin's desire to appeal to a more mature audience.

            His next hit, <i>Beyond the Sea</i>, had a swinging, 
            big bandâ€“style arrangement, which helped Darin make the transition to performing into the nightclub
            circuit. He set an attendance record at the famous Copacabana in New York City and began 
            playing casinos in Las Vegas.
