        The Chantels were one of the first female R&B vocal groups to have nationwide success.
        The five members, Arlene Smith, Renee Minus, Jacqulyn Landry, Sonia Goring, and 
        Lois Harris had attended <a href="http://stanthonynyc.org/">St. Anthony of Padua Elementary School </a> and were members of 
        St. Anthony's church choir. The inspiration for the group's name came from rival school, 
        <a href="http://www.sfdchantalschool.org/">St. Frances de Chantal</a>.

        Unlike many black groups whose influences were based in gospel, the group was influenced by classical music and Latin hymns. Lead singer 
        Arlene Smith had received classical training and performed at Carnegie Hall at age 12. What also set the Chantels apart from other groups on the day was Arlene Smith's writing
        abilities. She wrote both words and music.

       The Chantels were discovered by Richard Barrett, lead singer of the Valentines, and by the summer of 1957 they were signed to End Records.
       The group's first single, the Arlene Smith composition <i>He's Gone</i>, was released in August 1957. The song only got up to number 71 on the pop charts.
       The following year the Chantels had their biggest success with another Arlene Smith composition, <i>Maybe</i> (#15 pop, #2 R&B). The record sold over a 
       million copies nationwide and was awarded a gold record. Follow up singles were less successful, and the group was dropped by their label in 1959.

        Smith left the group to pursue a solo career. Harris left for college. In 1960, Annette Smith (no relation to Arlene), replaced Arlene Smith. 
        Now a quartet, the group moved to Carlton Records, where they had their second huge hit with <i>Look in My Eyes </i>(#14 pop, #6 R&B). The group disbanded in 1970.
        Arlene Smith went on to attend the prestigious <a href="http://discover.juilliard.edu/juilliard-music-overview?gclid=CLO0ueXonNACFUxLDQodynkH5Q"> Julliard School of Music</a> and became a school teacher in the Bronx.
        Original group member Jackie Landry Jackson died from breast cancer in December 1997.

        In 2002 The Chantels were inducted into The Bronx, NY “Walk of Fame” and the 
        <a href="http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees/the_chantels.html">Vocal Group Hall of Fame</a> in Sharon, Pennsylvania.
